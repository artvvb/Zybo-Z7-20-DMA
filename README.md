Zybo Z7-20 DMA Audio Demo
==============

Introduction
--------------

This project demonstrates a way to use the Audio Codec, DDR memory, and 3.5mm Audio Jacks included on the Zybo Z7-20 in order to record and play audio. Three of the four user push buttons can be used to record a 5 second snippet of audio from the microphone input (MIC IN) and line input (LINE IN) jacks, or to play a recorded snippet back out over the headphone output (HPH OUT) jack. The USB-UART bridge attached to the microUSB port is used to display status messages. The table below shows the functions mapped to each of the push buttons.

| Button | Function            |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| BTN0   | N/A                 |
| BTN1   | Record from MIC IN  |
| BTN2   | Play on HPH OUT     |
| BTN3   | Record from LINE IN |

16. Set the Zybo Z7-20's programming mode jumper (JP5) to "JTAG" and its power input select jumper (JP6) to "USB".
17. Plug the Zybo Z7-20 into the computer running SDK using a microUSB cable connected to the Zybo Z7's PROG/UART port (J12).
18. Plug in audio inputs and outputs to the 3.5mm headphone output (HPH OUT), line input (LINE IN), and microphone input (MIC IN) audio jacks.
19. Open a serial terminal application (such as TeraTerm FIXME LINK) and connect it to the Zybo Z7's serial port, using a baud rate of 115200. (FIXME more details here?)
20. In the toolbar at the top of the SDK window, select **Xilinx -> Program FPGA**. Leave all fields as their defaults and click "Program".
21. Right click on the "Zybo-Z7-20-DMA" application project in the Project Explorer pane, and select "Run As -> Launch on Hardware (System Debugger)".
22. Refer to the statements printed via the serial terminal application for instructions on how to use the demo.
